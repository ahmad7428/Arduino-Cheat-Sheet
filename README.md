# Code4ArduinoTutorial
Hello, World! Here lies in this repository, a file that contains the Coding Cheat sheet to get started with Arduino Programming in just 10 minutes. Enjoy :)

By the way, you'll need the Arduino IDE to open this file, which you can download from the following URL:

https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

and... you'll also need an Arduino.

If you don't have one, I recommend buying an Arduino Nano just because it's cheaper and smaller in size but offers the same capabilities as the Arduino UNO because both of them are based on the same microcontroller i.e. ATmega328P or ATmega168P.
